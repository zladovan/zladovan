### Sevas

Wellcome to my GitHub account page.

My official name is **Jan** but on the internet you can usually find me under name **Zladovan**. I created this nick name years ago based on popular fictional character [Zladko "Zlad!" Vladcik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyG-xu-7SQ).

#### Who I am

I am **open-minded** person. It's not only common cliché. I really do not like *“black and white thinking”* and arogant people not understanding that their **truth is not valid out of** their **model of thinking**. In opposite I feel very good surrounded by the people do not taking themselves too seriously.

I like to spend my time with

  - 💻 programming 
  - 🌳 hiking
  - 🧗‍♂️ rock climbing
  - 📚 reading
  - ❤️ making love  

#### Who I am from professional view

I am a generalist who feels the best while swimming in uncharted waters.

During **10+ years as a professional software developer** I participated on a development of various types of applications and I tried multiple roles. I have experience with: 

  - 🧪 testing
  - 🖼️ programming web UI's
  - ↔️ designing and implementing REST/gRPC API's
  - 📊 building data analytics platform
  - 🛠️ configuring automated builds
  - 📈 deploying and monitoring of what I have built

If you want to know more details about my professional career **[check out my CV](CV.pdf)**.

I must admit that **I do not see myself as an expert in any field** and I doubt I will become an expert one day. It's because I much more **like to explore new stuff** than to go too deep into something I already know. I understand the role of expertise and specialization but I really do not like to see me as a specialized component in the big machine doing the same thing over and over again.

#### What can you find on my GitHub

I am big fan of open source. **I learned a lot from open source projects** and **I like to share my work too**. See below for projects I build in my free time for fun or as a solution to some problem I was facing in private projects. Repositories are organised by me in order by *"my proudness"*. It strongly correlates with the popularity.
